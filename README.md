My approach for the calculator was to create a clean, user-friendly command-line interface that handles basic arithmetic operations. I implemented separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to maintain code modularity and readability.
The main challenges addressed include:
1. Preventing division by zero errors with a specific error message
2. Handling invalid inputs through try-except blocks for numeric values
3. Creating a repeatable workflow with a while loop for multiple calculations

I added these practical features:
1. Continuous operation capability through a loop structure
2. Clear user prompts with formatted output showing the complete equation
3. Error handling for both numeric input validation and division by zero
4. A simple exit mechanism allowing users to end the program when desired

The implementation prioritizes usability while maintaining simplicity, making it accessible for beginners while demonstrating fundamental programming concepts.
